# Qwen Code Enhancements

This directory contains the Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) for five non-code related enhancements for Qwen Code. These enhancements are designed to build a community and ecosystem around the tool, improving the overall user experience.

## The Five Enhancements

1.  **[Interactive Learning Platform](./learning-platform/):** A web-based platform with interactive tutorials and exercises to help users learn how to use Qwen Code effectively.
2.  **[Community Hub](./community-hub/):** A dedicated space for users to share their experiences, ask questions, and showcase their custom workflows and scripts.
3.  **[Usage Analytics Dashboard](./analytics-dashboard/):** A personal dashboard for users to track their token usage, command history, and get insights into their workflow patterns.
4.  **[Plugin/Extension Marketplace](./plugin-marketplace/):** A marketplace where users can discover, install, and share custom plugins or extensions that add new functionalities to Qwen Code.
5.  **[Gamification System](./gamification/):** A system that rewards users with badges, points, and achievements for using the tool, completing tutorials, or contributing to the community.

## High-Level Design

Each of these enhancements will be built as a separate web application. They will be designed to be simple and easy to use, with a focus on providing a good user experience.
