## 💡 Innovation Highlights

### 1. **Adaptive AI Behavior**
Each domain has specialized prompts and behaviors:
```bash
# Programming mode (existing)
> Analyze this React component

# Education mode
🎓 > Explain React hooks to a beginner

# Content mode  
📝 > Generate API documentation for this endpoint

# Creative mode
✍️ > Develop a compelling antagonist for my story
```

### 2. **Cross-Domain Workflows**
Workflows can span multiple domains:
```
Research Workflow:
1. Data Analysis: Analyze survey results
2. Content Creation: Generate research report
3. Business Process: Create publication workflow
```

### 3. **Intelligent Context Switching**
AI automatically detects domain from user intent:
```bash
> "Create a lesson plan for teaching Python" → Education Mode
> "Write API docs for our REST service" → Content Mode
> "Analyze customer churn patterns" → Research Mode
```
