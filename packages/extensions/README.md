**Usage:**
```bash
qwenverse create --environment code-city  # Create metaverse
qwenverse enter                           # Enter metaverse  
qwenverse host --collaborative            # Host session
```

## Installation

```bash
cd packages/extensions
npm install
npm run build
```

## Integration with QwenCode

These extensions integrate seamlessly with the existing qwen-code CLI and can be used alongside existing features.

## Architecture

Each extension follows the same pattern:
- **Analyzer**: Extracts relevant patterns from code
- **Generator**: Creates the creative output (3D, music, story, etc.)  
- **Server**: Provides web interface and real-time features
- **Tool**: CLI interface following qwen-code patterns

The synergistic QwenVerse orchestrates all tools together into a unified experience.
