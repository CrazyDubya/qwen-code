INGREDIENTS:
- 2 cups of algorithmic flour
- 1 cup of recursive sugar
- 3 eggs of object-oriented thinking
- 1 tsp of functional programming salt
- 1/2 cup of asynchronous milk
- 1/4 cup of quantum butter

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Preheat your quantum oven to 350¬∞F (177¬∞C)
2. Mix the algorithmic flour with recursive sugar
3. Beat in the object-oriented eggs one at a time
4. Add functional programming salt and asynchronous milk
5. Fold in quantum butter until smooth
6. Bake for 25-30 minutes until golden brown

NOTES:
This recipe was inspired by code patterns: ${patternNames}
The complexity reflects the ${difficulty} difficulty level
Serves 4-6 developers with a taste for innovation

INGREDIENTS:
- ${Math.ceil(codeLength / 10)} cups of code-inspired flour
- ${Math.ceil(servings / 2)} cups of creative sugar
- ${servings} eggs of innovation
- 1 tsp of debugging salt
- 1/2 cup of optimization milk
- 1/4 cup of refactoring butter

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Preheat your development oven to 375¬∞F (190¬∞C)
2. Mix the code-inspired flour with creative sugar
3. Beat in the innovation eggs one at a time
4. Add debugging salt and optimization milk
5. Fold in refactoring butter until smooth
6. Bake for 20-25 minutes until perfectly structured

NOTES:
Inspired by: ${codeSnippet.substring(0, 50)}...
Code complexity: ${codeLength} characters
Serves ${servings} hungry developers
